<br /> JusChat Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for Android.
<br /> JusChat uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) 
<br /> to let you message with friends and family. Switch from SMS to JusChat to send and 
<br /> receive messages.<br />
Right Now JusChat only offers messaging and sharing images service but the app is under progress and soon <br />
we will add some amazing features like sending calls, Video Calls, Voice Messages, etc.
